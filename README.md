# CIS-2100-Project-2

## Corporation Sales Simulation and Analysis

### Overview

This project provides a comprehensive simulation, analysis, and visualization of sales data for a corporation with multiple stores. The system generates annual sales data, exports it to a CSV file, and performs insightful analyses using Python libraries such as pandas, matplotlib, and seaborn. The main components include products, customers, orders, stores, and a corporation, enabling end-to-end simulation of business operations.

Key Features

1. Product Creation:

    Each product has a unique product_id, name, and price.

2. Customer Orders:

    Customers can place orders, which include a selection of products.

    Each order is assigned a unique order_id and includes metadata such as order date and total price.

3. Store Operations:

    Stores record customer orders and manage customer data.

4. Corporation Simulation:

    Simulates daily sales for a year across multiple stores, customers, and products.

    Sales data is stored in a structured format and can be exported to a CSV file.

5. Sales Data Export:

    Generated sales data is saved to a CSV file (annual_sales_data.csv) for external use.

6. Data Analysis & Visualization:

    Analyze trends such as popular products, customer purchasing behavior, and store performance.

    Visualize results using interactive charts and plots.
